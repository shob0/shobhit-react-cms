I was in my second year of graduation. This is also the time when people experience their first interaction with sweet pain called life. Few things had happened during that day. I don't remember the actual incidents; I remember the feelings. I remember lying in bed, thinking about it. I remember making fantasies, imaginary scenarios in my mind and then again fantasizing about making those fantasies true. Getting frustrated when the thoughts of them not happening as I planned.<br />\\n    <!--more--><br />\\n    <br />\\n    The whole night was spent in the same way. Lying in the bed, wishing sleep stops to elude me so that I can be energetic for tomorrow. The next day was not going to be any better. I was going to repeat the same behaviour again and then spent the night wishing I had done better. It has become a daily ritual. Every day spent in actions which I will fantasize about in the night to find ways to react in a cleverer way. Thinking this will show everyone. The whole night will be spent in the same fashion. Wishing and rolling on the bed.<br />\\n    <br />\\n    Then one day, as with every night, I was wide awake, thinking,&nbsp;&nbsp;mind-numbingly&nbsp;browsing Facebook and wishing: thoughts stop for one second! I can take rest then. The clock struck 4 when It dawned on me: Enough is enough. Something needs to be done for this. This can't go on forever.<br />\\n    <br />\\n    <div data-l=\\\"1\\\" style=\\\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: merriweather_extendedLtIt, lailaregular, NotoNastaliqUrdu; font-stretch: inherit;

Without any second thought, I put then on and was getting ready for a run. I had not slept the whole night and now I was running. I remember I ran till the market and then came back. It was a good 5K run.<br />\\n    <br />\\n    This was the time when I got introduced&nbsp;to the benefits of working out, running. I had not felt that good for a long time. I remember I put a status for that on Facebook. I was happy throughout the day and I slept great that night.<br />\\n    <br />\\n    Now after 8 years and when I know a little bit more, I understand what I unknowingly did. I understand that I had painful sensations, I had made myself numb to them in order to not feel them. By running, I replaced those unnoticeable painful sensations which were multiplying on a momentary basis with sensations of self-inflicted pain. Pain I could control and knew.<br />\\n    <br />\\n    I understood that everything I did was my willingness to survive in action. Sharing feelings on a platform, laying wide awake and at last going for a run, all allowed me to survive and be whatever best I could be. I look back at that person and pass him a smile.<br />\\n    <br />\\n    Since then I have done a lot to understand above. One might say fate has directed me to understand more and more about sensations and their relation to the emotions we feel. Yoga, running, gym, meditation, books everything comes down to me dictating how I will react to a certain feeling or situation. If a moment is gone, it's gone. <b><u>You can't be stuck in yesterday when 70KGs is waiting to drop on your chest and kill you.</u></b> You are forced to be in present. Probably this is why people feel better after the gym. For at least an hour, they stay in present.<br />\\n    <br />\\n    This post can't be complete without a shoutout to my friends Anshit &amp; Dheeraj who were there the whole time with me. From these guys, I learnt to be compassionate without trying to fix the problem. Letting people grow and resolve their issues in their own pace. Not trying to understand someone and loving their each and every personality.<br />\\n    <br />\\n    <div data-l=\\\"1\\\" style=\\\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: merriweather_extendedLtIt, lailaregular, NotoNastaliqUrdu;

So, this spring I decided to plant few tulips. This way I will have something else to proud of along with my Job. I bought 10 tulip bulbs and planted in different places. One of them, which will probably turn into a beautiful black tulip, I planted for my own room. Hence It was in a pot, others, in the garden.<br />\\n    <br />\\n    <!--more--><br />\\n    <br />\\n    After few weeks, the one in the pot started to raise his head: my first tulip. Others were probably still growing but under earth. The pot tulip grew so much that I had to shift it to a bigger pot. In the process, by mistake I planted it at an angle.<br />\\n    <br />\\n    After 2 more weeks, I was watering them same, giving a bit more nutrition to the pot tulip as It can't receive same from the mother earth. Others had also started raising their head. I couldn't be more happier. I was on cloud nine. 6 of the 10 have come out on the earth and I have to take less care of them.<br />\\n    <br />\\n    Interesting thing happened last Friday when I was watering them. One tulip, in the corner of garden was coming up very beautifully. It was straight, had very green leaves and growing as fast as on in the pot even though It saw sun after the latter. I thought to myself, \\\"I am most proud of this tulip.\\\"<br />\\n    <br />\\n    Being as stupid as I am, The reasoning started in the mind, <u>why I am only proud of this one. Others are also planted by me. They did not ask me to plant them. I am giving them same treatment, same water and everything. The reason pot tulip is slanted is because</u><u>&nbsp;I,</u><u>&nbsp;for starters, did not provide it proper contained environment. Why I am proud of only this one. Is this how I prioritize everything in my life: my friends, my relatives. And will this be the way I will continue&nbsp;</u><u>prioritizing things and people.</u><br />\\n    <br />\\n    Lastly after a very thorough investigation and mindful thinking, I decided to make an attempt to deliberately be proud of each plant. Every time, I am watering my tulips or tomatoes for that matter, I say to myself I am proud of this plant. Thanks for being the way you are. You are loved. Hopefully this change will also get reflected in life.<br />\\n    <br />\\n    Here is the pot plant:<br />\\n    <div class=\\\"separator\\\" style=\\\"clear: both; text-align: center;\\\">\\n    <br /></div>\\n    <div class=\\\"separator\\\" style=\\\"clear: both; text-align: center;\\\">\\n    <a href=\\\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wx7wgOZBSNE/XpNujSmrI3I/AAAAAAAAMys/f9fcZhC8KnkQWe3pAZJnpVO8ezkvQfyOACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/IMG_20200408_191855.jpg\\\" imageanchor=\\\"1\\\" style=\\\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\\\"><img border=\\\"0\\\" data-original-height=\\\"1600\\\" data-original-width=\\\"1200\\\" height=\\\"400\\\" src=\\\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wx7wgOZBSNE/XpNujSmrI3I/AAAAAAAAMys/f9fcZhC8KnkQWe3pAZJnpVO8ezkvQfyOACLcBGAsYHQ/s400/IMG_20200408_191855.jpg\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" /></a></div>\\n    <div class=\\\"separator\\\" style=\\\"clear: both; text-align: center;\\\">\\n    Pot Plant.</div>\\n    <div class=\\\"separator\\\" style=\\\"clear: both; text-align: center;\\\">\\n    <br /></div>\\n    <div class=\\\"separator\\\" style=\\\"clear: both; text-align: left;\\\">\\n    Will add others as I click more photos.</div>\\n    <br /></div>\\n    \",\n  date: new Date(),\n  author: \"Shobhit\"\n}, {\n  id: 3,\n  title: \"Toastmaster Speech 1 preparation\",\n  visibleData: \"After much avoidance and then deliberation, I have finally decided to join toastmasters.

It has been 3 months and now the time for my first speech is on its way. I have decided to give my speech as to how stammering is dealt on day to day basis.

Now when its only 18 days for the speech, Now I have started to practice. I have written the speech and it will be polished in due time. I have decided to practice it at-least three times everyday. The idea is inspired by a metaphor which I heard way back when I joined The Indian Stammering Association. Here goes the speech.<br />\\n    <!--more--></div>\\n    <div style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\n    <br /></div>\\n    <div style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\n    Dear Fellow Toast Masters, Let me start by asking you a simple question. \\\"Have you guys ever had a pet? If yes, Did you not love it to fullest!\\\". Everyone does. I too have a pet. It was given to me when I was born. I did not want it. But I did not have any say in that.</div>\\n    <div style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\n    <br /></div>\\n    <div style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\n    It was a very wild pet, very disobedient. A wild dog you can say. It will start barking whenever I am talking with somebody. I will scold it, threaten it, even punish it but no effect. Needless to say I hated it. I was even ashamed by it. I wanted but I could not get rid of it.</div>\\n    <div style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\n    <br /></div>\\n    <div style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\n    One day, I was walking down the road and I saw a guy with the same pet. But his pet was silent, not barking at all. It will start but the man will gently caress it and It will go back to be silent.</div>\\n    <div style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\n    <br /></div>\\n    <div style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\n    I was mesmerized. This person had something which I don't and Now I wanted it. I went ahead and asked him. He, a sixty year old guy, game me strangest advice I have ever heard. He told me to love the pet, be kind to it. If it barks, gently sooth it and it will be silent. I thought this guy is mad.&nbsp;</div>\\n    <div style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\n    <br /></div>\\n    <div style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\n    <b>How can you love something when it is giving you so much problems.</b>&nbsp;Anyhow, I decided to gave it a try. Every time it will bark, I will breathe and say to myself its okay. To my surprise, The wild thing actually became silent. I was flabbergasted. Now every time I was kind to it, it will be silent and If I go to my old patterns, It will start his own old patterns. I had got the secret now. If you love it, It will be a good friend, If you hate it, It will be a painful companion.</div>\\n    <div style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\n    <br /></div>\\n    <div style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\n    Even today, I am practicing to love it. Still sometimes I get angry on it or feel ashamed of it. But over the years, we have become good friends. Do you know who that friend is. I am sure each one of you have met him. Its stammering.&nbsp;</div>\\n    <div style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\n    <br /></div>\\n    <div style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\n    Thank you.</div>\\n    <div style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\n    <br /></div>\\n    <div style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\">\\n    -- I will upload the video as&nbsp; well once I have given the speech and attach it to the same.</div>\\n    </div>\\n

I was in my second year of graduation. This is also the time when people experience their first interaction with sweet pain called life. Few things had happened during that day. I don't remember the actual incidents; I remember the feelings. I remember lying in bed, thinking about it. I remember making fantasies, imaginary scenarios in my mind and then again fantasizing about making those fantasies true. Getting frustrated when the thoughts of them not happening as I planned.<br />\r\n    <!--more--><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    The whole night was spent in the same way. Lying in the bed, wishing sleep stops to elude me so that I can be energetic for tomorrow. The next day was not going to be any better. I was going to repeat the same behaviour again and then spent the night wishing I had done better. It has become a daily ritual. Every day spent in actions which I will fantasize about in the night to find ways to react in a cleverer way. Thinking this will show everyone. The whole night will be spent in the same fashion. Wishing and rolling on the bed.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Then one day, as with every night, I was wide awake, thinking,&nbsp;&nbsp;mind-numbingly&nbsp;browsing Facebook and wishing: thoughts stop for one second! I can take rest then. The clock struck 4 when It dawned on me: Enough is enough. Something needs to be done for this. This can't go on forever.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <div data-l=\"1\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: merriweather_extendedLtIt, lailaregular, NotoNastaliqUrdu; font-stretch: inherit;

Without any second thought, I put then on and was getting ready for a run. I had not slept the whole night and now I was running. I remember I ran till the market and then came back. It was a good 5K run.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    This was the time when I got introduced&nbsp;to the benefits of working out, running. I had not felt that good for a long time. I remember I put a status for that on Facebook. I was happy throughout the day and I slept great that night.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Now after 8 years and when I know a little bit more, I understand what I unknowingly did. I understand that I had painful sensations, I had made myself numb to them in order to not feel them. By running, I replaced those unnoticeable painful sensations which were multiplying on a momentary basis with sensations of self-inflicted pain. Pain I could control and knew.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    I understood that everything I did was my willingness to survive in action. Sharing feelings on a platform, laying wide awake and at last going for a run, all allowed me to survive and be whatever best I could be. I look back at that person and pass him a smile.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Since then I have done a lot to understand above. One might say fate has directed me to understand more and more about sensations and their relation to the emotions we feel. Yoga, running, gym, meditation, books everything comes down to me dictating how I will react to a certain feeling or situation. If a moment is gone, it's gone. <b><u>You can't be stuck in yesterday when 70KGs is waiting to drop on your chest and kill you.</u></b> You are forced to be in present. Probably this is why people feel better after the gym. For at least an hour, they stay in present.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    This post can't be complete without a shoutout to my friends Anshit &amp; Dheeraj who were there the whole time with me. From these guys, I learnt to be compassionate without trying to fix the problem. Letting people grow and resolve their issues in their own pace. Not trying to understand someone and loving their each and every personality.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <div data-l=\"1\" style=\"border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: merriweather_extendedLtIt, lailaregular, NotoNastaliqUrdu;

So, this spring I decided to plant few tulips. This way I will have something else to proud of along with my Job. I bought 10 tulip bulbs and planted in different places. One of them, which will probably turn into a beautiful black tulip, I planted for my own room. Hence It was in a pot, others, in the garden.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    <!--more--><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    After few weeks, the one in the pot started to raise his head: my first tulip. Others were probably still growing but under earth. The pot tulip grew so much that I had to shift it to a bigger pot. In the process, by mistake I planted it at an angle.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    After 2 more weeks, I was watering them same, giving a bit more nutrition to the pot tulip as It can't receive same from the mother earth. Others had also started raising their head. I couldn't be more happier. I was on cloud nine. 6 of the 10 have come out on the earth and I have to take less care of them.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Interesting thing happened last Friday when I was watering them. One tulip, in the corner of garden was coming up very beautifully. It was straight, had very green leaves and growing as fast as on in the pot even though It saw sun after the latter. I thought to myself, \"I am most proud of this tulip.\"<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Being as stupid as I am, The reasoning started in the mind, <u>why I am only proud of this one. Others are also planted by me. They did not ask me to plant them. I am giving them same treatment, same water and everything. The reason pot tulip is slanted is because</u><u>&nbsp;I,</u><u>&nbsp;for starters, did not provide it proper contained environment. Why I am proud of only this one. Is this how I prioritize everything in my life: my friends, my relatives. And will this be the way I will continue&nbsp;</u><u>prioritizing things and people.</u><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Lastly after a very thorough investigation and mindful thinking, I decided to make an attempt to deliberately be proud of each plant. Every time, I am watering my tulips or tomatoes for that matter, I say to myself I am proud of this plant. Thanks for being the way you are. You are loved. Hopefully this change will also get reflected in life.<br />\r\n    <br />\r\n    Here is the pot plant:<br />\r\n    <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\r\n    <br /></div>\r\n    <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\r\n    <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wx7wgOZBSNE/XpNujSmrI3I/AAAAAAAAMys/f9fcZhC8KnkQWe3pAZJnpVO8ezkvQfyOACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/IMG_20200408_191855.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1600\" data-original-width=\"1200\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wx7wgOZBSNE/XpNujSmrI3I/AAAAAAAAMys/f9fcZhC8KnkQWe3pAZJnpVO8ezkvQfyOACLcBGAsYHQ/s400/IMG_20200408_191855.jpg\" width=\"300\" /></a></div>\r\n    <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\r\n    Pot Plant.</div>\r\n    <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\r\n    <br /></div>\r\n    <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">\r\n    Will add others as I click more photos.</div>\r\n    <br /></div>\r\n    `,\r\n    date: new Date(),\r\n    author: \"Shobhit\",\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: 3,\r\n    title: \"Toastmaster Speech 1 preparation\",\r\n    visibleData: `After much avoidance and then deliberation, I have finally decided to join toastmasters.

It has been 3 months and now the time for my first speech is on its way. I have decided to give my speech as to how stammering is dealt on day to day basis. How I treated it way back in time and how I treat it now. This speech is going to be difficult and I am trying not to look back and run away.</div>\r\n    <div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    <br /></div>\r\n    <div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    I had two months to prepare but I always pushed it on the back burner or say kept avoiding it as It is difficult to think and then write. Now when its only 18 days for the speech, Now I have started to practice. I have written the speech and it will be polished in due time. I have decided to practice it at-least three times everyday. The idea is inspired by a metaphor which I heard way back when I joined The Indian Stammering Association. Here goes the speech.<br />\r\n    <!--more--></div>\r\n    <div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    <br /></div>\r\n    <div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    Dear Fellow Toast Masters, Let me start by asking you a simple question. \"Have you guys ever had a pet? If yes, Did you not love it to fullest!\". Everyone does. I too have a pet. It was given to me when I was born. I did not want it. But I did not have any say in that.</div>\r\n    <div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    <br /></div>\r\n    <div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    It was a very wild pet, very disobedient. A wild dog you can say. It will start barking whenever I am talking with somebody. I will scold it, threaten it, even punish it but no effect. Needless to say I hated it. I was even ashamed by it. I wanted but I could not get rid of it.</div>\r\n    <div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    <br /></div>\r\n    <div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    One day, I was walking down the road and I saw a guy with the same pet. But his pet was silent, not barking at all. It will start but the man will gently caress it and It will go back to be silent.</div>\r\n    <div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    <br /></div>\r\n    <div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    I was mesmerized. This person had something which I don't and Now I wanted it. I went ahead and asked him. He, a sixty year old guy, game me strangest advice I have ever heard. He told me to love the pet, be kind to it. If it barks, gently sooth it and it will be silent. I thought this guy is mad.&nbsp;</div>\r\n    <div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    <br /></div>\r\n    <div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    <b>How can you love something when it is giving you so much problems.</b>&nbsp;Anyhow, I decided to gave it a try. Every time it will bark, I will breathe and say to myself its okay. To my surprise, The wild thing actually became silent. I was flabbergasted. Now every time I was kind to it, it will be silent and If I go to my old patterns, It will start his own old patterns. I had got the secret now. If you love it, It will be a good friend, If you hate it, It will be a painful companion.</div>\r\n    <div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    <br /></div>\r\n    <div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    Even today, I am practicing to love it. Still sometimes I get angry on it or feel ashamed of it. But over the years, we have become good friends. Do you know who that friend is. I am sure each one of you have met him. Its stammering.&nbsp;</div>\r\n    <div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    <br /></div>\r\n    <div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    Thank you.</div>\r\n    <div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    <br /></div>\r\n    <div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n    -- I will upload the video as&nbsp; well once I have given the speech and attach it to the same.</div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    `,\r\n    date: new Date(),\r\n    author: \"Shobhit\",\r\n  },\r\n];\r\n\r\nfunction GetPosts() {\r\n  return obj;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction getPostById(id) {\r\n  let ret = obj.filter(function getPostByGivenId(o) {\r\n    return o.id == id;\r\n  });\r\n  return ret[0];\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst Stub = {};\r\nStub.GetPosts = GetPosts;\r\nStub.getPostById = getPostById;\r\n\r\nexport default Stub;\r\n"},"lineCount":null}},"error":null,"hash":"9379fc936f3f787a364c119297972dda","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
